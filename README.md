# empirical_mode_decomposition
This repo contains an implementation of the Empirical Mode Decomposition. In the nothebook "EMD.ipynb" a signal is created from the summation of sin waves of different frequencies and amplitudes. Then the EMD is applied to the total signal to extract the corresponding Intrinsic Mode Functions (IMFs).)
